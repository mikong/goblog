[Alexander Dinerchtein](http://breakfast.go4go.net/) launched a new Go website this month called [Go Sensations](http://gosensations.com/). The site publishes the most interesting games played on the largest Go servers in the world (KGS, Cyberoro, Tygem, IGS, Dragon, Dashn, etc). I like the simplicity of the website, and itâ€™s great that games are added frequently (always with good introductions, sometimes with game review comments). The identity of the legendary tartrate was even revealed in [an article there](http://gosensations.com/index.php?id=2&server_id=1&new_id=53), and it was followed up by other articles about him.

This month, I created the [Philippine Go Association group](http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/group.php?gid=57992477880) in Facebook. The group is open to everyone so you donâ€™t have to be a registered member of PGA to join. The main purpose of this Facebook group is to increase the awareness about the game and the association. Thereâ€™s also the [Go Players on Facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2204656513) which seems to be the generic Go group in Facebook. Itâ€™s quite big, and seems to be the official Go group on Facebook (it is led by prominent people in the US Go community and a [wiki entry](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Facebook) has already been created in [Senseiâ€™s Library](http://senseis.xmp.net/)). Be sure to check them out if youâ€™re in Facebook.

Even though Iâ€™ve known KGS for quite some time now, Iâ€™m not very familiar with its features. After a friend introduced me to the [KGS archives feature](http://www.gokgs.com/archives.jsp), I checked if my suspicions are correct. And Iâ€™ve confirmed it, Iâ€™ve played more games in the last 2 months vs almost 2 years before that (in KGS alone). Iâ€™ve only finished 17 games in KGS in the period of Feb 2007 to Nov 2008. While Iâ€™ve played 17 games last Dec 2008, and 14 games this Jan 2009. [Another friend](http://twitter.com/bonglapis) also introduced [KGS clan games](http://www.kgsclans.co.uk/?page=aboutclans) in [our mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/philippine-go-association) and we now have the [Ultra Electro Magnetic Clan](http://www.kgsclans.co.uk/forum/viewforum.php?f=89). Itâ€™s been encouraging me to play more so I really appreciate it.

Those are some of the Go highlights in my life this month. Looking ahead, it seems like thereâ€™ll be a lot of Go activities for me to write about so stay tuned. ðŸ™‚
