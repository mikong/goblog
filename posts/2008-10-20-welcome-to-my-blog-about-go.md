After thinking about it for a year, it’s finally here. My Go blog is up and I have some ideas for my next few articles. If you don’t know what Go is, read this [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)).

I’ll be writing about my Go learning resources like books and websites. I’ll also be describing Go activities that I participate in. So far, these activities are only either here in Metro Manila or online. Some of them are official activities of the [Philippine Go Association](http://www.phgo.org/), while others are organized by local Go players. I hope some day I’ll be able participate in Go activities in other countries so I can write about them too. :)

I’m also building up my personal list of [top 100 Go games](../top-100-games.md). There are only 3 items in the list at this time but I’ll be adding more and more games soon.

So welcome to my Go blog and I hope to hear from you. Post some comments or join the [mailing list of Philippine Go Association](http://groups.google.com/group/philippine-go-association).
