My round 8 game may have been the most interesting game for me. Dominik Mueller, my opponent from Switzerland, used some very interesting opening moves which includes a tengen move for Blackâ€™s 3rd move. Once again, I had a very good opening, but ended up losing coz of some bad moves in the middle game. I resigned late in the game.

As Dominik and I started reviewing the game, we were having trouble judging some moves. Mr. Min Sung Suh from the Korean Amateur Baduk Association (and formerly a Korean insei or yeongusaeng) was very kind to have offered to review the game for us after he noticed our problem. The following is the review as far as I could remember (recorded in SGF some days after the actual review, so may be inaccurate):

In this tournament, I realized I was quite good in the opening, but severely lacks the skill in the middle game (particularly fighting). This was my last game in the tournament, and I was hoping I could get my 3rd win. But I didnâ€™t, even with a very good opening. I was a bit disappointed soon after the game, but the disappointment quickly faded. I had a really great time and I found myself smiling a lot after even though I had a score of only 2 out of 8 rounds. Iâ€™ve learned so much. The games, even the ones Iâ€™ve lost, were very enjoyable. And I met so many people. I canâ€™t wait to participate in more international tournaments.
