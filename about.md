# About

Iâ€™m Mikong and welcome to my Go blog.

This blog is where I share my experiences learning or simply having fun with [Go, my favorite board game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_board_game). I hope you find my articles useful and enjoyable.

If you have any suggestions and constructive criticisms, please post your comments.
