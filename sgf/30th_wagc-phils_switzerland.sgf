This game was reviewed with Min Sung Suh, a representative from KABA and a former yeongusaeng (Korean insei). I tried to remember as much as I can about the review because I only recorded this days after the review when I got back from Japan. So there may be some errors in the game/review.]RE[B+Resign]

;B[jj]C[Black said he played this opening so the game quickly develops into a fighting game.]
;W[jd]C[A good counter to black's strategy.]
;B[qj]
;W[gd]C[This move is somewhat slow. E16 may be better.]
;B[dc]
;W[qf]
;B[np]
;W[pn]C[I considered playing R6 but this feels better, because it makes it easier to neutralize black's influence on the left. Black thinks R6 is better because Q6 leaves white open. But I think black couldn't invade immediately in this position, and before black could slide to S6, black still needs to have a stone at R8 anyway. Mr. Suh said this move (Q6) is better because of the tengen stone.]

;W[ql]
;B[oj]C[I remember from some Go lessons before that one should make a base first before jumping out, so I thought Black should first make a base with R12. But Mr. Suh said this is better because black needs to escape faster because of the strong white groups around and because of the K10 stone.]

;B[kn]
;W[mm]C[I first needed to defend by cutting point at N6.]
;B[lk]C[Good move to protect the weakness of K10 stone.]

;W[hi]C[This is not the end of the game but we only reviewed the game up to here. White unnecessarily made black stronger, lost territory at the top (H17 area is also now open on both sides). Fighting occurred in the middle of the board and white loses more points ending in a resignation.])

(;W[qb]C[This is to protect white's weakness and the corner is now solid territory.])

(;W[lp]
;B[kq]
;W[jp]C[This is better according to Mr. Suh. White has a better shape and becomes stronger in black's moyo. Even though black becomes stronger in the bottom, he is still open at Q2.]))
