Many thanks to Yamada Noriyoshi, 9-dan pro and tournament referee, for reviewing this game. I only recorded this SGF when I got back from Japan, so I may have some errors in the game/review.]RE[B+50.50]

;W[np]C[I was thinking of P4 but I was worried about not knowing the joseki for that, so I kept my distance. According to the review by the pro, this move is ok.]

;W[fq]C[To play tenuki here is wrong for white. Q6 is urgent for both sides.]

;W[ip]C[White successfully made L4 stone weak.]
;B[jq]C[This is a mistake. Q6 is urgent for both black and white.]
;W[lq]C[A mistake for white. Q6 is still urgent.]
;B[kn]
;W[im]
;B[pn]C[Black got the big move.]
;W[mn]C[A good move. I started to worry about my initial strategy of attacking black in the middle, because I thought maybe it's easier for black because he only has one group, and I have 2. But the pro said that my strategy is fine, because although white has 2 groups to worry about, they are both much stronger than the 1 weak black group in the middle.]
;B[iq]C[Black should jump out to the middle at L8 to separate the white groups.]

;W[km]C[Now white is connected. At this point, white is better, at least in the exchange so far. Note that black got secure territory on the right, so maybe overall about equal.]

;B[fn]C[This loss is too big for white.]
;W[jc]
;B[cj]C[This is too close to black's influence. Black should approach white at D15. I never saw that move. I was hoping black would take the corner at C16, and I could build a moyo by pressing him down with D15. But that was hoping for too much.]

;B[lc]C[This invasion is not necessary because black is already leading.]
(;W[nd]C[This is too slow. See variation.]

;W[jd]C[Again, too slow. Should hane at J16.]

;W[ld]C[This is not the end of the game, but pretty much where the review ended. White is behind and playing slow moves will not help him catch up.])
(;W[kd]C[White should at least try to attack black to try to catch up. Although one variation that the pro showed was that black lives anyway, but he said I should at least try to make the game complicated and difficult for black.]))
(;W[ho]

;W[go]C[To escape with the F3 group is big. Black is still not alive in the middle. I forgot the variations shown by the pro.]))
