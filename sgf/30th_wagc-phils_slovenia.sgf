It was an honor to have the game reviewed by Yamada Noriyoshi, 9-dan pro (he was one of the tournament's referees). But note that I only recorded this when I got back from Japan, so some details may be off.]RE[W+30.50]

;B[ro]C[Better to hane underneath at S6. Black is strong in the area and should not be afraid. This exchange is good for white.]

;B[pp]C[I thought this was slow too, but the pro said this one is fine.]
;W[kl]C[This is too far. White could be cut.]

;W[dh]
;B[nk]C[A good move, strengthening black, building moyo and threatening to cut a big group.]
;W[km]C[This is a mistake. A simple kosumi at N8 is better.]
;B[ln]C[This move is aggresive, a bit dangerous but ok and playable. The pro tried the variation if white cut at K6 but it's not possible. However, white has the peep at J6 in reserve for building the left side later.]
;W[lq]C[This is wrong. White should still connect at N8.]
;B[lp]C[Wrong direction. Black should block at L3.]
;W[kq]

;W[iq]C[The pro first suggested J4 instead of J3, and then tried a variation for that, but it ended up good for black. So he said this (S3) is better.]
