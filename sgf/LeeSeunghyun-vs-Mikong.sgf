;B[pj]C[I asked if this extension is ok. She said it's ok.]
;W[oi]
;B[qh]C[She said this is a good move.]
;W[qg]
;B[ph]
;W[og]
;B[oh]C[The intention to make cutting points is good, but it's better not to touch white's group, just use haengma (shown later).]
;W[ng]
;B[mf]C[The idea is good, but not really necessary.]
;W[nh]
(;B[pg]C[This is wrong. Use haengma to connect the 2 black groups (see variation).]
;W[of]
(;B[qf]C[Wrong again. Use the haengma instead (see variation).]
;W[qe]
;B[rg]
;W[re]C[Black group is now separated.]
;B[le]C[This is a good way to connect to J16.]
;W[ld]

;B[je]C[Black is now connected and the group is safe for now.]

;B[pk]
;W[nl]
;B[mi]C[This peep is not necessary.]
;W[ni]
(;B[ec]C[My idea here is to chase white group to the center, and then have my black center group attack the white group originating from F17 and the other white group O13. But Ms Lee said it is not a good idea because black in the center is not strong. It's better to just press white down (see variation).]
;W[fe]
(;B[hg]C[There is a simple way for black center group to connect to the corner group (see variation).]
;W[fg]
(;B[fd]C[Black shouldn't attack by touching. He can still connect with G17 move or jump to the center (see variation).]
;W[gd]

;W[ge]
;B[gc]C[Again, do not attack by touching white.]

(;B[fc]C[Black should not connect here, it's too slow. And it can be used as a ko threat later (see variation). ]
;W[hd]C[Now white has become strong because of the touching moves. White is also connected to the white corner group.]
(;B[gi]C[This is a little dangerous with the cut at J14 (see alternative).]
